## Project Description
The project scope was to visually analyze datasets within a very short period of time.
Additionally the results had to presented to public (with no pre-knowledge about data science and finance) within 3 minutes.

Project Description:
Through huge amounts of subsidies for farmers and somehow unfair international trade contracts, the EU drives a rather unbalanced agriculture business with Africa.
The aim of this work is to analyze the cross-border food business between the EU and sub-sahara Africa.
For this the balance sheet of agricultural products, the direct agricultural product business of the regions and other economic components of agirculture for the regions will be analyzed.

The importance of investments and expinditures for the agricultural business are not implemented yet.

## Hypotheses / Questions
Is the international agricultural product trade of the EU and sub-sahara Africa unbalanced?
How important is this business for the economies of these countries
(How important are investments and expenditures of goverments)

## Dataset
Different datasets were used for this project:
[Food Balance Sheet](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS)
Was used to show the net exports for agricultural products of the regions

[Trade Matrix](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TM)
Was used to show the true net export between the two regions

[Agriculutre Value Added & GDP](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&series=NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS&country=)
This dataset was used to analyze the importance of the agricultural value added for the economies of the regions

The data of the following datasets was imported, but is still not prepared and analyzed to this stage:
[Goverment Expenditures](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/IG)
[Credit to Agriculture](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/IC)
[Development flows to Agriculture](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EA)
[Foreign Direct Investment to Agriculture](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FDI)


All datasets are also available in the repository.

## Workflow
### Define the hypothesis
    * As the analyzed hypothesis also determines the workload it had to be choosen carefully as the scope was to analyse data in a very short period of time
    * Many hours were spend on the definition of interesting hypothesis that can be answered as correctly as possible
    
#### Research about the topic:
    * To define hypothesis that fit to the mentioned scope a huge research about the topic have been done
    * Questions to be answered were:
        * Is there an easy way to show the true situation
        * Is usefull data available

### Dataset preparation
    * One part of the datawork took already place on the websites of the databases, as preselections had to be made. For this it was important to understand the structure and variables of the databases
    * The cleaning and matchin of dataset was done successively
        
### Analyze datasets
    * Before the visualization of the datasets, the strucutre and distrubution was analyzed
    * Afterwards several plots were tested to find the most accurate presentation

### Preparation of the presetnation 
    * For the presentation ppt with the prior ploted graphs were build
    * The main difficulty was to build a presentation that fits the scope of 3 minutes and is easy to understand for the public (non-data scientist and no financial knowledge)

#### Technical Paper
    * A quasi technical paper (describing the work) was implemented into the jupyter notebook file

## Organization

The project flow was predefined and plannend on Trello.
With the support of an assigned mentor the scale of the project was set. Additionally, the mentor provided suggestions and constructive feedback over the entire project work.

The data work and analysis was completed solely wiht Jupyter Notebook.
Among others libaries Pandas and Seaborn were used to fullfill the tasks
